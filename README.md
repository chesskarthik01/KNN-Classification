# KNN-Classification
Creating a KNN classification algorithm using sci-kit learn for a dataset containing unknown variables.
<br> Elbow method is also used to choose a k value which has a reduced error rate, and improve the model.
<br> I've tried all sorts of import combinations, but for whatever reason the plot for error rate vs k value doesn't appear to render either on github or externally on binder or nbviewer. You'll have to locally install and run the jupyter notebook to see the graph.
