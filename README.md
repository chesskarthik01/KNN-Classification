Creating a KNN classification algorithm using sci-kit learn for a dataset containing unknown variables.
<br> Elbow method is also used to choose a k value which has a reduced error rate, and improve the model.
<br> The interactive plot which was created using plotly (for error rate vs k) can be viewed externally in binder.
